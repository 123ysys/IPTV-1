# IPTV
IPTV is a simple python script that let you crawl the search engines
in order to fetch those sites that stream illegal tv programs.

This script leverage the fact the a lot of those sites use the same
CMS to create the web application and sharing the service, behind a CMS there's
always some exploits.
We are using one simple exploit to grab and crawl the site's url and use for our
purpose.

# How to use

* Clone the repository `git clone git@github.com:Pinperepette/IPTV.git`
* `cd` into `IPTV`
* run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to get the full dependencies
* run `python iptv.pl -h`

## This program is just a demonstration. DO NOT USE IT FOR PERSONAL purpose ##

### We are not responsible of the usage ###

## Ethical Dilemma

Even though those services are illegal, stealing from a thief is still stealing.
